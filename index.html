<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>I wanted to make you something different.</p>
<p>Everyone expresses their love in different ways. I try express mine to you with my words and actions.</p>
<p>Whether that be complimenting you and telling you how much I love you, or cuddling with you, spending time with you, kissing you.</p>
<p>I was thinking, what is a present to express my love that she would never even dream of getting? And then it came to me...</p>
<p>I thought, why not dedicate a whole website to you? After all I'm doing higher computing science, it's something I know how to do</p>
<p>In my big handmade letter for you, (assuming you've read it now, I'm sure you have), I didn't focus on the right thing. And so this is my way of fixing it. I love you for you, your personality and the way you act, not your body, and I don't think my love letter represented that, and so I hope this fixes it</p>
<p>Finally i'd like to add that i'm sorry this doesn't look the best. This website definitely won't win any awards for it's looks or functionality, but I hope it works. I made this at night on the 16th (hopefully same day you're reading this), and I wanted to get it ready for you as a little thing for you to wake up to, so I promise the next one will be wayyyyyy better looking</p>
<p>Also 2 more thing actually. 1: "Why the funky colour scheme, it looks ugly" Green represents life, blue represents the ocean, and calmness, both of which you give me an eminate, and so I picked them. 2: please go through this in chronological order, from my favourite things -> what sets you appart etc.... thanks in advance</p>
