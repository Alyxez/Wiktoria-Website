<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>I wanted to make you something different.</p>
<p>Everyone expresses their love in different ways. I try express mine to you with my words and actions.</p>
<p>Whether that be complimenting you and telling you how much I love you, or cuddling with you, spending time with you, kissing you.</p>
<p>I was thinking, what is a present to express my love that she would never even dream of getting? And then it came to me...</p>
<p>I thought, why not dedicate a whole website to you? After all I'm doing higher computing science, it's something I know how to do</p>

<p>Think of this as a late valentines present. It took me a lot of time to make this, so I hope you appreciate it my love :)</p>
<p>Finally i'd like to add that i'm sorry this doesn't look the best. This website definitely won't win any awards for it's looks or functionality, but I hope it works</p>
