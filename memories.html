	<h2>You Coming  Back Into My Life</h2>
</div>

<div>
	<p>November 25th, 2023. The day you decided to message me on tiktok.</p>
	<p>At first I was in shock you messaged me. Of course you messaged me once before to tell me about the garlic chilly chips, but I gave you a dry reply that time because I was mad at you. This time was different. You explained your reasons to me and I understood, I couldn't blame you for doing what you did (removing me).</p>
	<p>Accepting you back into my life was the best possible thing I could have done</p>
</div>


<div>
	<h2>My Feelings For You Forming</h2>
</div>

<div>
	<p>I don't know the exact date they formed, but I know it was very early on in December.</p>
	<p>What drew me to you rather than someone else? Well you already know from an earlier page, but I'm more than happy to state again a couple reasons why</p>
	<p>You:</p>
	<li>Actually cared for me</li>
	<li>Made me feel wanted</li>
	<li>Showed me that regardless of time, connections can still be strong</li>
	<li>Filled me with happiness when we talked</li>
	<li>Made hours of my time fly by (Good Thing By The Way)</li>
</div>

	<h2>Confessing To You</h2>
</div>

<div>
	<p>January 1st, 2024. The day I told you I liked you</p>
	<p>I think what genuinely made me tell you was the fact you comforted me while I was drunk that night. You reassured me that the girl I liked (you) may say yes to me. You comforted me for hours on end while I cried my eyes out to you, about you, without you realising it, and for that I will forever be grateful. I've never done that to anyone. In the sense that I cried to them and looked for support, you were the first person I ever opened up to like that.
	<p>Morning came and off I went to work, when the cheesiest opportunity for me to tell you arose</p>
	<p>You told me you had to go, and while I didn't want you to because I wanted to keep talking to you, you told me, and I quote "you can go talk to that girl you like". Those are words I'll never forget because they led up to the next big moment...</p>
	<p>Thats when I said it. I said "But I already am talking to her, because I like you"</p>
	<p>When you told me you liked me too, after I started jumping to early conclusions, It had made my whole year already, not even 14 hours into it. It was the greatest present I could ever ask for.</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>Cuddling</h2>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Im sorry, these next parts might sound a little cheesy, but I'm speaking from the heart here so I hope you can look past that</p>
	<p>I was really nervous at first. This was my first time being at another girls house, let alone in a room 1-1 with one (I sound like a proper nerd saying this jee wizz). I was so scared to do something wrong. I didn't want to make you uncomfortable, and so I didn't make any attempts to try hug you. Thankfully you did, and I loved it. Being close with you was amazing. I felt so at peace, all thoughts gone, simply my love for you in mind.</p>
	<p>I think what I've learned about myself is that hugging and just cuddling with someone is most definitely my love language. I've learned I love doing it, and you've helped me figure that out, and so I thank you.</p>

	<h2>Dinner</h2>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Saturday 10th February. The day we had our early valentines.</p>
	<p>This was my first time taking anyone on a date, and so yet again I was nervous, but it went well</p>
	<p>Even though it was a little awkward at first, it flowed well once we settled down. We sat, we ate, and we laughed at that funny blow up balloon manaquin person thingy</p>
	<p>Now for the funniest part of the night. Even though we were soaked and were out, I finally showed you I could in fact carry you easily. Walking around, with you in my arms, giving you the princess treatment you deserve, when all of a sudden we hear "OMG ITS OSCAR". Jeeeee wizzz was that funny.
</div>

<div>
	<h2>First Kiss</h2>
</div>

<div>
	<p>I know this wasn't like a proper first one where people go at it for like a bajillion years, but a kiss is a kiss, especialy considering how many we had, so it definitely works for me.</p>
	<p> I think this was my favourite day so far. I think things just flowed so well. I got to cuddle you sm again (I think you can tell I love cuddling with you).</p>
	<p>I had this whole elaborate plan originally that before my train left, I was going to kiss you on the lips goodbye (i regret not doing it, I only did it on your forehead befoer I got on), but you did it first.</p>
	<p>I was in shock when you kissed me. But like good shock. And then we kept doing it and it was amazing, I loved every bit of it. Having you next to me, on me, just by my side cuddling and kissing was the best valentines I could have ever asked for.</p>
